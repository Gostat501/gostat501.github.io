# "Go stat!"

Welcome to my webpage! I am a Sr. Science Integration Analyst at the Walt Disney Company (under furlough). My undergraduate degree is a B.S. in Statistics and Minor in Mathematics with summa cum laude at University of California, Los Angeles (2019). During my undergraduate period, I was a research assistant under the supervision of Prof.Frederic Paik Schoenberg. I am currently in a transitory period in preparation of pursuing a PhD program in Statistics, dedicating my entire time studying for GRE, documenting, and compiling up my knowledge and fidings in Time-Series Analysis.

As a survivor of numbers of catastrophic upheavals throughout the world – SARS at Beijing, China 2003, Tohoku earthquake and its proceeding powerplant meltdown at Fukushima, Japan 2011, and the concurrent COVID-19 pandemic – I am guided to comprehend hazardous events and systematize the resilient society in which human lives can be saved under such events. That being said, my life resolutions are to analyze various environmental/social hazards and to construct ways of circumventing such events via Statistics and Mathematics as primary means.
