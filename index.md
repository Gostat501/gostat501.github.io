# "Go stat!"

Welcome to my webpage! I am a Sr. Science Integration Analyst at the Walt Disney Company (under furlough). My undergraduate degree is a B.S. in Statistics and Minor in Mathematics with summa cum laude at University of California, Los Angeles in June 2019. During my undergraduate period, I was a research assistant under the supervision of Prof.Frederic Schoenberg. I am currently in a transitory period in preparation of pursuing a PhD program in Statistics, dedicating my entire time studying for GRE and compiling up my knowledge and fidings in Time-Series Analysis.

I was predisposed to discover the efficient "path-finding" - from constructing toy train rail-road network as a kid, to unearthing the latent network structures in social pheomena in time-space perspective as a statistician. That being said, my life resolution is to find efficient paths under various environmental or social hazards, such as evacuation, traffic alleviation, resource allocation, urban-planning, and geo-politics etc. for facilitating more sustainable society while using statistics as primary means to accomplish such.

Although I was born in Tokyo, Japan, I spent my childhood in Beijing, China / K-12 in Fukushima, Japan / community college in Riverside, California.
